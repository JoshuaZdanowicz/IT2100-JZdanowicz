#  Background Color     
This app allows for chainging of the view controler background color. 
This functionality is turnd on or off via a toggle switch. 
If turned on a slider can change the background color of the view. 
I have adjusted the color vaules from what the orginal vaules were and placed an identifying label within the view so the purpose of the 
app is more readily apparent to the user.
